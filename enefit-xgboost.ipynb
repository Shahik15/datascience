This concept represents a shift from the traditional model where consumers simply purchase energy from utilities and rely on centralized power generation sources. Energy prosumers are actively involved in the energy ecosystem by generating their own electricity, typically through renewable energy sources like solar panels (or wind turbines, small-scale hydropower etc.). They also consume energy from the grid when their own generation is insufficient to meet their needs\n\n<div style=\"border-radius:10px; border: #babab5 solid; padding: 15px; background-color: #e6f9ff; font-size:100%; \">\n    \n* The number of prosumers is rapidly increasing, associated with higher energy imbalance - increased operational costs, potential grid instability, and inefficient use of energy resources.\n* The goal of the competition is to create an energy prediction model of prosumers to reduce energy imbalance costs\n* If solved, it would reduce the imbalance costs, improve the reliability of the grid, and make the integration of prosumers into the energy system more efficient and sustainable.\n*  Moreover, it could potentially incentivize more consumers to become prosumers and thus promote renewable energy production and use.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Description\n> 📌**Note**:  Your challenge in this competition is to predict the amount of electricity produced and consumed by Estonian energy customers who have installed solar panels.
